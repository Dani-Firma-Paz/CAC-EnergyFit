This is Tessellate, a brand new responsive site template by AJ for HTML5 UP. It's a
single pager (a format I'm pretty into right now), has styling for a crapload of
basic elements, and includes a handy "dark" modifier class to flip a given element
to a light-on-dark color scheme.

friend of mine over at deviantART. See more of her incredible work here:
